<h1>About Autonomous Vehicles</h1>

<p> An autonomous vehicle is a self-driving car that has different levels of input needed to operate. There are 5 levels to Autonomy, driver assistance, partial automation, conditional automation, high automation, anf full automation. These all connect back to the amount of sensors, cameras, and algorithms of road activity needed to differentiate between whether the car needs human attention and if it can operate completely on its own. It positively impacts society by improving living conditions for those in need such as elderly and physically disabled people who may find trouble getting around. It can also reduce traffic percentages, transportation cost, and much more. There are, however, some down-sides to this autonomy; While it can make aspects of life easier, the car must have to take into consideration weather conditions, current traffic readings, federal law (which may cause problems depending on where the car is located) and more.
